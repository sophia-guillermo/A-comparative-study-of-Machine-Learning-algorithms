# A comparative study of Machine Learning algorithms
A side-by-side comparison of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors on the wine classification dataset.

## Project overview
This study compares the performance of three popular supervised learning algorithms using the wine dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and result analysis.

## Files included
- `AComparativeStudyofMachineLearningAlgorithms.ipynb`: Full notebook implementation
- `README.md`: This file

## Technologies used
- Scikit-learn (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN)
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Confusion matrix and accuracy metrics

## How to run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload to Google Colab
2. Execute cells sequentially

## Key Takeaways
1. Evaluated trade-offs between model complexity and performance
2. Applied hyperparameter tuning techniques
3. Strengthened understanding of supervised learning methods
